                <p>The Sorsu E-Voting System uses short, clear notifications to guide the user through every critical stage of the election.</p>
                
                <p> Notifications begin in the Pre-Voting phase, alerting users that Voter registration is now open! and sending an urgent reminder like Final day to register for the Sorsu elections! as the deadline approaches.</p>
                
                <p>Once the polls open, Active Voting notifications immediately inform the user that Sorsu E-Voting is LIVE! and create urgency with reminders such as Only 12 hours left to vote! Finally, in the Post-Voting phase, the system confirms major actions with alerts like Your vote has been successfully recorded and keeps users informed on the results status, sending a final notification when Official Results are OUT!</p>
                
                <p>This phased approach ensures users are constantly aware of their next action and the election's current status.</p>
                
                <p>Let's all welcome ang paborito nating mars, Camille Prats!! Wohoooo. Thank you!</p>
